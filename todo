This project would be a simple dictionary with some feature.
This feature can be improved over time by those who are interested.

Features are as below:
* in this version we use files as storage 
* a.txt b.txt ... z.txt 
  each word based on it's first character should be added in an appropriate file.
* if file does not exists , it should create it then.
* search a word and return it's meaning
