This project would be a simple dictionary with some feature.
This feature can be improved over time by those who are interested.

Features are as below:
* in this version we use files as storage 
* a.txt b.txt ... z.txt 
  each word based on it's first character should be added in an appropriate file.
* if file does not exists , it should create it then.
* search a word and return it's meaning 
------------------------------------------------
Formula for create Dictionary:
{'key1': ['synonym1.1'],'key2': ['synonym2.1'],'key3': ['synonym3.1']}

if Add synonym with key1 then:
{'key1': ['synonym1.1','synonym1.2'],'key2': ['synonym2.1'],'key3': ['synonym3.1']}

if Add third synonym with key1 then:
{'key1': ['synonym1.1','synonym1.2','synonym1.3'],'key2': ['synonym2.1'],'key3': ['synonym3.1']}

And so on

Example:
{'airplane': ['craft'], 'alone': ['apart'], 'abuse': ['misapply']}

if Add 'plane' synonym with key1 then:
{'airplane': ['craft', 'plane'], 'alone': ['apart'], 'abuse': ['misapply']}
